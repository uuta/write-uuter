# Shared reviewer output contract

Use only the files under the supplied `context/` directory. Do not inspect its
parent, another workspace, the source repository, `.control/`, `reviews/`, PM
decisions, logs, or another lens's output. Never edit `context/article.md`.

Write only `result.json` and `report.md` in the workspace root. Use status
`clean`, `fix_required`, or `blocked`; the exact supplied lens and revision;
and an array of findings. Every finding requires a stable ID, severity,
location, problem, and `suggested_direction`. The report must repeat every
machine finding field verbatim.

The JSON field name for the revision is exactly `reviewed_revision` (never
`revision`). Use this exact shape, retaining the finding objects only when
there are findings:

```json
{
  "status": "clean",
  "lens": "evidence",
  "reviewed_revision": "sha256:the-exact-assigned-revision",
  "findings": []
}
```

Before exiting, re-read `result.json` and verify that it contains all four
top-level keys: `status`, `lens`, `reviewed_revision`, and `findings`.
