## S1 — httpbingo.org redirect endpoint
- Location: https://httpbingo.org/redirect-to?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F
- Accessed: 2026-08-30 (via WebFetch tool)
- Summary: A test-utility endpoint (httpbingo, an httpbin-compatible service) that issues an HTTP 302 Found redirect. The `Location` response header points to `https://example.com/`, matching the `url` query parameter supplied in the request. The tool used to access this page reported the redirect rather than auto-following it, and explicitly flagged the target as "server-supplied, not verified" until independently fetched.
- Use: Establishes that the brief's supplied redirect URL leads to https://example.com/ via a standard 302 redirect, and that this is the destination actually reached, not a substituted URL.

## S2 — example.com landing page
- Location: https://example.com/
- Accessed: 2026-08-30 (via WebFetch tool; fetched separately after following the redirect reported by S1)
- Summary: A minimal single-page site. Visible content extracted by the fetch tool:
  - Heading: "Example Domain"
  - Body paragraph: "This domain is for use in documentation examples without needing permission. Avoid use in operations."
  - A "Learn more" link, pointing (per the tool's description) to further detail on IANA's website.
- Use: Primary evidentiary basis for the article's description of what the page visibly says and what it identifies its own purpose as.
- Caveat: The fetch tool processes raw HTML through an intermediate summarization step rather than returning raw markup verbatim. The heading and general meaning ("for documentation examples," "no permission needed") are consistent with the well-known, long-standing content of this reserved domain, but the exact sentence-level wording returned should be treated as tool-reported rather than independently byte-verified. See claim-ledger for how this caveat is classified.
