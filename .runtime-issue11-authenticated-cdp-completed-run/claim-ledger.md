# Claim Ledger

Classifications used: Fact, Firsthand observation, Inference, Opinion, Unresolved.

## claim-001
- Statement: The supplied URL `https://httpbingo.org/redirect-to?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F` returns an HTTP 302 redirect whose Location header is `https://example.com/`.
- Classification: Firsthand observation
- Basis: S1. Observed directly via the fetch tool, which reported the redirect status and target rather than silently following it.

## claim-002
- Statement: Following that redirect leads to the page at https://example.com/.
- Classification: Firsthand observation
- Basis: S1 + S2. The redirect target was independently fetched at S2 and returned content, confirming the destination is reachable and is the one named in the redirect, not a substituted URL.

## claim-003
- Statement: The example.com page displays a heading reading "Example Domain".
- Classification: Firsthand observation
- Basis: S2.

## claim-004
- Statement: The page's visible body text states that the domain is for use in documentation examples and does not require permission to use, and it advises against use in "operations."
- Classification: Firsthand observation
- Basis: S2. Caveat: extracted through an AI-mediated fetch/summarization step rather than raw HTML retrieval, so exact sentence boundaries/punctuation are tool-reported. The substance (documentation-example use, no permission needed) is corroborated by the domain's long-established, widely-documented public purpose.
- Screenshot support: shot-001 (requested) is intended to let the Visual Editor independently confirm this claim against captured pixels.

## claim-005
- Statement: The page includes a "Learn more" link to further information (described by the fetch tool as pointing to IANA).
- Classification: Firsthand observation
- Basis: S2.

## claim-006
- Statement: example.com is a domain reserved by IANA for illustrative/documentation use, historically associated with RFC 2606 reserved names.
- Classification: Inference
- Basis: Not independently verified in this run (out of scope per brief: "domain-name history" is excluded). Included only as background context if needed; must not be presented as directly sourced from S1/S2.

## claim-007
- Statement: The exact byte-for-byte HTML wording of the example.com body paragraph, beyond the tool-reported summary in S2.
- Classification: Unresolved
- Basis: No raw-HTML fetch capability was available in this environment (only an AI-mediated WebFetch tool); shell/curl access was not available. The screenshot requested as shot-001 is intended to give the Visual Editor an independent, pixel-level check against this same claim.
